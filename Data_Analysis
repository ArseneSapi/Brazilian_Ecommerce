## SQL Data Analysis Techniques used
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
I employed subqueries and CTEs to break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts, thus simplifying queries for improved organization and readability.

- CASE Statements:
The CASE function was critical for embedding conditional logic within my queries. By categorizing and grouping data based on specific conditions, I created custom columns that enhanced the flexibility and depth of my analysis.

- Window Functions:
I utilized window functions for tasks that required comparing the values of previous years to the current data. These functions allowed me to compute metrics over specific data partitions, providing richer insights without the need for complex joins or subqueries.

- JOINs:
I combined data from multiple tables using JOINs, ensuring accurate relationships between datasets. This approach enabled a comprehensive view of the data, leading to more informed decision-making and thorough analysis.
